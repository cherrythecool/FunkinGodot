# FunkinGodot

[Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) modding framework made
in the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org) to be a useful project in making
whatever you want. It comes with stable, fast performance and easier creation thanks
to building on and working with Godot's systems.

To get a feel for the gameplay as-is, try out one of the [precompiled releases](https://github.com/cherrythecool/FunkinGodot/releases/latest) with some
songs from the base game.

To make a mod just download [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download) and the source code from
this repository. Then, import the project into Godot and get started! Documentation is
currently scarce, but will be worked on in the future (and until then, you can always submit issues).

## Credits

See [CREDITS](CREDITS.md) (or in game) for the credits of different people/groups that
have put a contribution into making this all possible!
