# FunkinGodot

[Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) modding framework made
in the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org) to be a useful tool in making
whatever kind of mod you want, with more performance and easily accessible features
thanks to Godot and its extensible Node and Resource systems.

## Features

* High accuracy to the base game's look and feel (with some changes)
* Different scriptable parts to songs such as
	- Cutscenes
	- Events
	- Note Types
	- General Scripts
* Custom scenes used for characters and stages, allowing practically unlimited possibilities
* Generally relies on being closer to Godot itself, allowing songs to load fast
 and efficiently most of the time
* Adobe Texture Atlas support via [gdanimate](https://github.com/what-is-a-git/gdanimate)
* More not mentioned and/or to come!

## Godot Version

This project is built for whatever the latest Godot 4.4.1 stable build is as of the latest changes (4.4.1 stable as of writing, 14 March 2025)

## State of this branch

The rewrite has been a major success and now I finally have a Godot FNF project
I'm happy with again. There will be more improvements to come but major work
will be more put into having the features to, and porting, the V-Slice version
of the game itself.
